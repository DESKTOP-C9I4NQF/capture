            <em>Subject</em>: <b>Arrival of Death</b><br><br>
            Everyone is going to die one day or another so this is very convenient topic to talk about.<br>
            if someone told another that today is your <b>last Day of Life</b> then Listener is definitely 
            going to freak out or going to do something that is not intended.<br>

            Once space shuttle was going to fall in India So people in rural region think that they have couple of days of their life and started eating good food<br>

            ------------------------------------------------------ I don't care if I die.
                    Increasing time
            </pre>

            I care about my life: People who are living for themself or their beloved one. there only goal is to save there life for doing something that is necessary for them to do.<br>
            Never thought about death or life: We have so much work and we don't have time to think about it.<br>
            I don't care if I die: People don't have anything to lose, they live to make either world a better place or worst place.<br>
            <b>I don't care if I die</b> people are more dangerous than <b>I care about my life</b> We will see in upcoming points.<br>

            <br>
            <b>How can we Increase the Stressor level of death?</b><br>
            Remove your Laptop cable from charging then, tie it with your head. Now Increase stress level of cable, you will resulted with increase in your stressor level of death<br>
            <br>
            <b>How can we decrease Stressor Level of Death?</b><br>
            I drive at 90*'s !<br>
            *that is speed limit of my vehicle and that is fine because my vehicle can't hurt anyone<br>
            Now In front of me there are two conditions if i met accident either I can choose to die or not.<br>
            If I select not to die and reaction time that is intensionally very low. so I need to lose my body parts.<br>
            but another way that is to die which is very easy to implement. So I try to converge my reaction time nearly to zero.<br>
            <em>What we learn from previous points that In order to decrease stressor level of death,<br>
            we need to give a reason to our mind that is more powerful and painful then previous one.</em><br>

            It's not necessary that people with Less stressor level of death will destroy The world or anything <br>
            But As we have seen In past that big named warriers like Hitler there stressor level of death is got very low <br>
            because they have seen thing that is more painful.  That resulted in death of many innocent victim's death.<br>
            
            <br>
            <b>Summary</b><br>
            It's necessary to keep stressor level of death in balance Keep ourself connected with work.<br>
            Before decreasing or increasing your stressor level of death think about total number outcomes <br>
            if I do this what would happen, and choose that is more reliable to you.<br><br>
