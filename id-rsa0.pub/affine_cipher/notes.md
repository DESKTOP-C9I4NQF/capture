> Can you brute force the classical cipher ?   

**In this level we need to brute force all possible plain text and then find plain text of
interest**  
***After grepping for COMMON WORD LIKE `the` I am able to find required plain text*** 

```sh
printf "COMMERCE ON THE INTERNET HAS COME TO RELY ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SERVING ASTRUSTED THIRD PARTIES TO PROCESS ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS. WHILE THE SYSTEM WORKS WELL ENOUGH FORMOST TRANSACTIONS, IT STILL SUFFERS FROM THE INHERENT WEAKNESSES OF THE TRUST BASED MODEL. COMPLETELY NONREVERSIBLE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT REALLY POSSIBLE, SINCE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CANNOTAVOID MEDIATING DISPUTES. THE COST OF MEDIATION INCREASES TRANSACTION COSTS, LIMITING THEMINIMUM PRACTICAL TRANSACTION SIZE AND CUTTING OFF THE POSSIBILITY FOR SMALL CASUAL TRANSACTIONS,AND THERE IS A BROADER COST IN THE LOSS OF ABILITY TO MAKE NONREVERSIBLE PAYMENTS FOR NONREVERSIBLESERVICES. WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF REVERSAL, THE NEED FOR TRUST SPREADS. MERCHANTS MUSTBE WARY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS, HASSLING THEM FOR MORE INFORMATION THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE NEED. A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF FRAUD IS ACCEPTED AS UNAVOIDABLE. THESE COSTS AND PAYMENT UNCERTAINTIESCAN BE AVOIDED IN PERSON BY USING PHYSICAL CURRENCY, BUT NO MECHANISM EXISTS TO MAKE PAYMENTSOVER A COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL WITHOUT A TRUSTED PARTY." | md5sum
