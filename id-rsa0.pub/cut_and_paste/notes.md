# Cut and Paste Attack On AES-ECB
> Create a valid ciphertext without knowledge of the key using some copypasta.
In this level we know that AES-ECB mode generate cipher with blocks of
16 bytes so we take first block of first cipher and from second cipher
we will take second block and then from third cipher we will select second
block and form our target cipher by parts.
